    title: What should I pick?
    subtitle: Maybe you're wondering whether it is a good idea to change your pick. Maybe you're already completely connected to a champion in particular. Or maybe you just have no idea what you should focus on. Unfortunately, the game meta changes almost every single day. But, don't worry, I can recommend you the best pick according to your preferences right now! (At least for today).

    top:
      name: Top
      description: Champions in top lane are the tough solo fighters of the team. It’s their job to protect their lane and focus on the enemy team’s most powerful members.
    jungle:
      name: Jungle
      description: Junglers live for the hunt. Stalking between lanes with stealth and skill, they keep a close eye on the most important neutral monsters and pounce the moment an opponent lets their guard down.
    mid:

      description: Mid laners are your high burst damage champions who can do it all—solo and as a team. For them, combat is a dangerous dance where they’re always looking for an opportunity to outplay their opponent.
    bot:
      name: Bot
      description: Bot lane champions are the dynamite of the team. As precious cargo, they need to be protected early on before amassing enough gold and experience to carry the team to victory.
    support:
      name: Support
      description: Support champions are team guardians. They help keep teammates alive and primarily focus on setting up kills, protecting their teammate in bot lane until they become stronger.
